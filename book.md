# Welcome

Welcome to Learn! Over the next 800-1000 hours you will learn everything you need to know to get started as a Full Stack Web Developer. Before you get started, just a few thoughts about to learn best using learn.co. It's going to be harder, and more rewarding than any other learning experience you've ever had, we promise. Let's learn together.

## Learning How To Learn

The most common misconception we get when people start this course is that we're teaching you Ruby, Javascript, HTML and CSS. Don't get me wrong, we are going to teach you those things, but that's actually not the most important set of things you're going to learn.

Over your career as a professional developer you're probably going to end up programming in languages that haven't been invented yet. The most important thing we're going to teach you is how to learn. Using the technologies above, we'll work with you to build the skills required to read and understand error messages and to google for the answers so once you get a job as a developer, when you have to learn a new library, framework or language, you'll know just how to go about doing so. We'll also teach you this first set of languages so that you can contribute immediately using them as a junior software developer.

## The Learn IDE

When you first start learning to code the amount of setup you have to do to get your computer ready to really *make* something can be frustrating. To counter this, we created the Learn IDE. If you haven't already, you should [download the Learn IDE now](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/how-to-download-and-use-learn-ide-3). The Learn IDE uses a popular programmers text editor (Atom) and also provides you with a terminal window for running commands, just as you would as a professional developer. However, instead of having to configure your local computer to allow you to program, it runs your commands on a remote computer so you can jump right into the programming - rather than spending hours configuring your computer. Bear in mind, using the IDE does mean you will have to be connected to the Internet while you program, but it's a much easier way to get started.

Once you've completed your first portfolio project review, you can then look into setting up a [local environment](http://help.learn.co/workflow-tips/local-environment/installing-a-supported-local-environment). There are lots of ways of getting your computer set up for programming (especially if you have a Mac or run a version of Linux as your operating system), but the way recommended in the link above (using a "Virtual Machine" - a separate computer within your computer) is the only one we can provide support for. If you have any more questions about when to move from the IDE to a local environment, [this article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/the-basics-of-the-learn-ide/using-the-ide-versus-a-local-environment) should help!

## Instructional support

We provide a wide range of instructional services and it's really important that you take advantage of them if you want to succeed with the program. The key resources are: Ask A Question, Study Groups, Project 1:1's and Section Lead 1:1's.

### Ask A Question

Whenever you get stuck for more than a few minutes, start by clicking on the "Ask A Question" button at the top right of [learn.co](https://learn.co/). We have a team of Technical Coaches who will respond to you ASAP (usually within a minute) and if they can't get you going again with a couple of comments, they'll set you up with a screenshare where you get 20 minutes of personalized 1:1 support. We usually try to get you on a screenshare within 30-45 minutes of connecting with you, although at busy times it may take a little longer. Make sure to use Ask A Question early and often. It's the best way to get immediate help with labs.

It is important to realize that Ask A Question is an educational - not customer support - function. Their goal isn't to tell you the answer (we could email you all of the answers for the whole course but that wouldn't help you to become a programmer). Their goal is to help you to learn how to learn by asking you questions and helping you to get better at key tasks like reading error messages and googling for answers. It'd be quicker for us just to tell you the answers, but our goal is to help you to build the skills to succeed as a professional developer, and the most important skill a developer has is the ability to figure things out on their own.

### Study Groups

You can host your own study groups to connect with and learn with other students. However, we also run over 40 study groups a week that are "Flatiron hosted" to help you to learn to code.

There are seven different types of study groups:
- **Orientation**: Optional advice and information on getting started with the program. Usually on Mondays every week. If you can't make it, feel free to watch the recorded version [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9iOq3EZxfE)
- **Motivational** (Thoughtful Thursday, Coders Unite, etc): The objective of these is to allow students to connect and chat about their experiences of being on learn and to motivate each other.
- **Office Hours**: A chance to connect with an instructor to ask any technical questions you might have
- **Portfolio Project Prep**: A chance to talk with an instructor about any questions you might have about designing or building your portfolio project review app
- **Lab Specific**: A combination of code along and a description of the underlying concepts.
- **Live Lecture**: A study group that focuses on a key concept rather than a specific lab.
- **Advanced**: Technical study groups covering content not specifically within the core curriculum like algorithms or Test Driven Development.

Make sure to sign up for at least one study group a week. They're a great way to see other perspectives, to pick up tough topics, to get your questions answered and to connect with your peers in the program.

### Project 1:1's

Most of the time on Learn, you're going to be working through readme's (lessons that only require you to read some text or watch a video) and labs (where you have to write code to get tests to pass). However, there are also five Portfolio Projects where you get to build a complete app from scratch. If you have questions about how to get started with your portfolio project or get stuck while working on it, instead of using Ask A Question, schedule a session with a Technical coach [here](http://bit.ly/portfolio-project-support). Filling out the form will pair you with a coach that specializes in helping students with the project you're working on.

### Section Leads

Section Leads are your Instructors. You’ll have a designated Section Lead for each major section of the curriculum, who is responsible for making sure our students are successful in that part of the course. Section Leads also conduct 1:1 Project Reviews to determine whether students are prepared to move onto the next section. 

Contact information for each Section Lead can be found here: http://help.learn.co/instructional-support/receiving-course-support/who-are-the-section-leads

### Educational Coaching

We offer the opportunity to speak with an Educational Coach as a non-technical support to check-in and help you stay accountable to your goals, anchor to your motivation in learning to code, and make steady forward progress at a pace that is right for you. If you are interested in this resource and would like to be paired with a coach, please email edcoaching@flatironschool.com and let us know about your goals in learning to code!

## The Learn IDE In Browser

The IDE In Browser is the fastest way to get coding on Learn. If you are not already using the IDE In Browser take a look at [this support article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/ide-in-browser).

## Career Services

As you go through the curriculum, we know you are concerned about what the end looks like. More specifically, we bet you are interested in how getting a job as a software engineer works here at The Flatiron School. Well! Rebekah, our VP of Career Services put together this video to answer your burning questions. Enjoy!

# Intro To Tic Tac Toe in Ruby

## Objectives

1. Learn about building Tic Tac Toe in Ruby.

## Introduction

In this course, we're going to learn how to build [Tic Tac Toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) in Ruby. Just in case you're unfamiliar with the game, let's discuss the rules first. Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3 x 3 grid of available cells, and the goal of the game is to place three of your tokens (X or O) on the grid in a row, including diagonals.

The following example game is won by the first player, X:

![X Wins](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Tic-tac-toe-game-1.svg/958px-Tic-tac-toe-game-1.svg.png)

## Why build Tic Tac Toe?

I'm sure you're really excited about building the next Facebook or Instagram, but like most things in life, we have to crawl before we walk, and walk before we run---and build Tic Tac Toe before we build large and complex applications.

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game that flexes the basic concepts in programming. For example, a Tic Tac Toe program requires data structures for storing the board and conditional logic for knowing whose turn it is or if someone has won. 

Tic Tac Toe's simple rules are very easy to decompose into small, discrete functions that we can put together to create a complete game. This process of *decomposition* and *synthesis*, breaking something down and putting it back together, is absolutely essential to programming.

The simple interface Tic Tac Toe requires, a basic 3 x 3 grid, is also easy to port to multiple interfaces. We can build a command line version of Tic Tac Toe or a web-based version. We can even build a SMS version of Tic Tac Toe if we wanted.

![Web Tic Tac Toe](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/q3yyuquszgh5g4y/2015-09-29%20at%2010.45%20AM.png)

![CLI Tic Tac Toe](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/71iskdi76syyqhb/2015-09-29%20at%2010.46%20AM.png)

Beyond being able to move easily between interfaces, we can also move between programming styles, building Tic Tac Toe in a procedural or functional style first, then moving that to an Object Oriented version, and finally, adding our Tic Tac Toe model to a Sinatra Web Application.

Once you've built your basic 2-player version of Tic Tac Toe, you are free to extend it by creating a 1-player version and trying to program an unbeatable AI.

## Pseudo-Code for Tic Tac Toe

The general procedure for Tic Tac Toe is as follows:

1. Create a structure to store and represent the state of the board.
2. Welcome the players.
3. Get the user's move in the form of some input.
4. Make sure their move is valid.
5. Check to see if the game has been won or came to a draw.
6. Change the player turn and let the next player make a move.
7. Repeat until the game is over.

As you progress through this course, we'll break all these requirements down into simple, cumulative labs throughout the track. You'll be surprised at how quickly you'll learn to do something this complex.

Let's get started learning enough Ruby to build Tic Tac Toe.

# MINSWAN: Matz and the Ruby Language
![](http://readme-pics.s3.amazonaws.com/imgres-1.jpg)


>The goal of Ruby is to make programmers happy. I started out to make a programming language that would make me happy, and as a side effect it’s made many, many programmers happy.

>I hope to see Ruby help every programmer in the world to be productive, and to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby language.

>-Yukihiro Matsumoto

## What is Ruby and Where Did it Come From?

Ruby is a dynamic object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan. Matsumoto, often referred to as "Matz", first developed the idea for Ruby in the early 1990s. From Matz's post to the *ruby-talk* mailing list in 1999:

>I was talking with my colleague about the possibility of an object-oriented scripting language. I knew Perl (Perl4, not Perl5), but I didn't like it really, because it had the smell of a toy language (it still has). The object-oriented language seemed very promising. I knew Python then. But I didn't like it, because I didn't think it was a true object-oriented language — OO features appeared to be add-on to the language. As a language maniac and OO fan for 15 years, I really wanted a genuine object-oriented, easy-to-use scripting language. I looked for but couldn't find one. So I decided to make it.

## Why Do We Love It?

Matz designed Ruby in order to make programmers happy. He developed a programming language that would be simple to use, elegant to write, but capable of building vastly complex things. A few of his own thoughts on Ruby sum it up best:

>Make Ruby natural, not simple, in a way that mirrors life.

and:

>Ruby is simple in appearance, but is very complex inside, just like our human body

## The Ruby Community

The Ruby community is characterized by respect for one another and a love of programming. Rubyists have a saying: "Matz is nice, so we are nice", or **MINSWAN**. Matz made a nice language to please programmers. Matz is nice to programmers, so we are nice to each other. The Learn community takes this principle to heart. We respect one another and the hard work that we are doing to learn how to code. We support one another to overcome obstacles to our learning. When another Learner asks a question, we respond respectfully and with a positive attitude. We don't judge or criticize each other. When we provide feedback to each other on the work that we're doing, it is consensual, actionable, specific, and kind. Learning to code, which you're doing here and will continue to do over the entire course of your programming life, is hard. We don't want to make it even harder on each other by failing to adhere to the MINSWAN principle. Remember, we are all on a journey to learn to love to code together.

# What is a Program?

### Objectives:

* Describe a program.
* Distinguish between interpreted and compiled programs.
* How to run a Ruby program in your terminal.
* List and describe the words that compose code: keywords, barewords, and data.
* Identify when and why errors occur in programming.

<iframe width="960" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P1cUm7BokaQ?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[MP4](http://flatiron-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ironboard/ruby/ruby-lecture-what-is-a-program/ruby-lecture-what-is-a-program.mp4)

### What's a Program?

All programs are just files on your computer filled with text. That text has a special syntax we call code. The programming language you're using defines the syntax of the code you are allowed to write. Programs are converted to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) so that the computer can understand it.

### Interpreted vs Compiled

Depending on the programming language you're using, it will either be a [compiled language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language) or an [interpreted language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language). Compiled programs will first be converted to machine code and then you will be able to run the program. Interpreted languages will be interpreted and converted to machine code at run time.

### Running a Ruby Program

Once you have a Ruby program as a file, you can run it through the Ruby interpreter to execute it. Your Ruby interpreter is accessible via the `ruby` command in your command line (assuming you have ruby installed correctly).

When you type in `ruby -v` you should see the version of Ruby you are currently running.

```bash
ruby -v
ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x86_64-darwin14]
```

As an example, to run a Ruby program that was stored in `some-program.rb` you would simply type: `ruby some-program.rb`. 

### Words in a Program

Every word and character in a program has to be valid code for the Ruby language. Basically, every word can be one of three possible things:

1. A Ruby keyword, something that's part of the ruby language.
2. Literal data, things like "Strings" and numbers like 1 or 2.
3. Barewords you define and create, things like variables and methods.

Anything that isn't one of those is invalid and the Ruby interpreter will throw an error. 

Let's say you ran a program, and saw the following output (pay attention to the last line):

```
Programs are composed of basically three things:
A language's keywords, like 'if' or 'end' (approximately 43).
Literal pieces of data like this very sentence (or String).
Finally, barewords, or variables, that are set equal to things.
Anything that isn't one of those will cause an error.
lib/a_ruby_program.rb:23:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `see' for main:Object (NameError)
```

That last line, `lib/a_ruby_program.rb:23:in '<main>': undefined local variable or method 'see' for main:Object (NameError)` is telling you that there was an error caused by an unrecognized word in the source of our program, more specifically on line 23.

We'll soon learn all about reading error messages.

# Hello World

## Overview

We're going to make a file that will print ["Hello World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) to your terminal.

## Objectives

1. Create a new Ruby file.
2. Write syntactically valid code to produce "Hello World!"
3. Run a Ruby file.
4. Run the Learn gem.
5. Submit a Learn lab.

## Instructions

Get started by clicking the Open button in Learn. 

### Creating a File

You will need to create a text file called `hello_world.rb` within the lab's directory. The `.rb` file extension is a common convention for specifying the language of the file - in this case, Ruby. To create this, in the Learn IDE's terminal type `touch hello_world.rb` or use the "Create New" or "New File" option in the Editor. If that worked as expected, you should now see the file appear in the file browser. You can open this file by double clicking on it in the file browser. You should now see an empty file open in your text editor, ready to be edited. 

### Writing Code

In the file `hello_world.rb` that you created, you need to write a single line of code that prints the string Hello World! to your terminal. To print in Ruby, you need to use the method `puts` which is short for "out**put s**tring." And because Hello World! is a string, you need to surround your text with `""`.

File: `hello_world.rb`
```ruby
puts "Hello World!"
```

Anytime you make changes to a file (like the one you've just made) you need to save the file, so your changes are preserved. If you forget to save the file before you run your tests, the last saved version of the file will be run — without your changes — and this can be very confusing! In this case, if you forget to save, what gets run might be just an empty document (which won't do anything very exciting). Always remember to save the file every time you make changes by selecting Save from the File menu.

### Executing Your File

Execute this file by typing `ruby hello_world.rb` into your terminal and pressing `enter`. The `ruby` part of that command tells your computer to use the Ruby interpreter when reading and executing the code in your file. The second part of the command, `hello_world.rb` is the path to the file you want to run.

Note: be sure to save your file before trying to print, otherwise it will not work.

You should see:

```bash
$ ruby hello_world.rb
Hello World!
```

### Running Learn

Confirm everything is working by running the `learn` command. You should see that all tests are passing (e.g. no red error text). 

Note: When you write code, the case (uppercase/lowercase) of characters matters, and so your test will not pass unless you print "Hello World!" exactly. 

### Submitting Your Lab

Submit your solution by typing `learn submit` into your terminal, then click Next Lesson to move on.

Your adventure in Ruby has only just begun!

### Hello World History

A small piece of coding history—a handwritten version of Hello World in C (an early programming language). 

![Hello World! Art](https://d32dm0rphc51dk.cloudfront.net/b6JQ66-0nHij79irJT-Pdg/large.jpg)

_[Hello World! by Brian Kernighan, from Artsy's Algorythm Auction](https://www.artsy.net/artwork/brian-kernighan-hello-world) based on a 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian Kernighan, Programming in C: A Tutorial, which contains the first known version._

# Welcome Message for Tic Tac Toe

## Overview

We're going to build a simple program that implements only the very first thing a complete Tic Tac Toe program would require, which is to greet the player with a welcome message.

## Objectives

1. Read the output from running `learn`.
2. Use `puts` to print "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!"
3. Have tests pass locally by running `learn`.
4. Submit solution.

## Instructions

1. Run `learn`
2. Read output.
3. Code solution in `lib/welcome.rb`
4. Run `learn`
5. Read output.
6. If still broken, repeat 3-5
7. If passing, submit with `learn submit`

## Troubleshooting

Here are some things you can try to get more clues to solve the lab.

### 1. Try running `ruby lib/welcome.rb`

When you run `ruby lib/welcome.rb` from your terminal you are asking the Ruby interpreter to run your program. If you see no output, like below, that means there is no code in `lib/welcome.rb` to print "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!".

**Note:** The file `welcome.rb` already exists in the folder `lib`, but is not displayed in Learn IDE default view. 

![No Puts](http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ruby/no.puts.in.code.gif)

The solution to this is to make sure you have `puts "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!"` in `lib/welcome.rb`. A working program should look like:

![Working program](http://learn-co-videos.s3.amazonaws.com/ruby/working.tic.tac.toe.rb.gif)

**Note:** Contrary to the workflow of the previous lesson, it is NOT necessary to create a new file to contain the 'puts` instruction.  

**Hint: Make sure you've saved `lib/welcome.rb`.**

### 2. Make sure you're printing "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!" exactly.

When you run `learn` you might see failing tests even though your program seemingly works. The failures might read something like:

```
1) lib/welcome.rb prints "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!"
   Failure/Error: load './lib/welcome.rb'
     #<IO:0x007fa2b28325a0> received :puts with unexpected arguments
       expected: ("Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!")
            got: ("Welcome to Tic Tac Toe")
   # ./lib/welcome.rb:4:in `puts'
```

An error like this is telling you that the test expects you to print `"Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!"`, but you printed something else. Programming is absolutely precise, make sure your tests are printing exactly "Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!".
